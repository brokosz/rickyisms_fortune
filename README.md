## About

*Rickyisms* is the term devised by the fans of Trailer Park Boys for [Ricky](https://trailerpark.fandom.com/wiki/Ricky)'s malapropisms and eggcorns (substitution speech errors.) Most of Ricky's speech errors are idiomatic in nature resulting in a phrase (or word) that are linguistically incorrect, but phonetically similar. These slips of the tongue are often the result of Ricky’s lack of education, and extensive use of drugs and alcohol, and situations where he may not be thinking clearly. Ricky’s speech errors are possibly some of the most entertaining aspects of his character, and arguably of the entire show.
